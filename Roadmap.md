Here are some new feature ideas for ScriptDeck:

1.Script Output Panel:
Show the output of each script in a dedicated output panel within the extension, with color-coded logs and error highlighting.

2.Script Favorites & Pinning:
Allow users to pin or favorite frequently used scripts to the top of the panel for quick access.

3.Script Arguments Prompt:
Prompt the user for custom arguments before running a script (e.g., npm run build -- --prod).

4.Multi-root Workspace Support:
Detect and show scripts from multiple package.json files in a multi-root workspace.

5.Script History:
Keep a history of recently run scripts and allow users to re-run them easily.

6.Environment Variable Management:
Let users set environment variables for scripts directly from the panel or settings.

7.Script Grouping:
Group scripts by type (e.g., test, build, start) or by custom tags for better organization.

8.Auto-Detect Package Manager:
Automatically detect the preferred package manager based on lock files (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml).

9.Script Scheduling:
Allow users to schedule scripts to run at a specific time or interval.

10.Notifications on Script Completion:
Show a desktop notification when a script finishes, with success or error status.
